# Car_prize_prediction
predicted car prize using linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor and Knn regressor
In this project I have removed outliers, made data into normal distribution, check for homoscedasticity and converted all non numeric data into numeric form and then computed MAE, MSE, RMSE for each model and after comparing we can decide best model.
